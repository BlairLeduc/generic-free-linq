# A Generic-Free Linq Implementantion
This is a generic-free Linq implementation in C#. This was originally part of the [Grommet Library](https://grommet.codeplex.com/).

Originally created for the .NET MicroFramwork, I moved this to GitHub, just in case someone could find some use for it.  As it stands, it is not complete.
