# A Generic-Free Linq Implementation
This is a generic-free Linq implementation in C#. This was originally part of the [Grommet Library](https://grommet.codeplex.com/).

Originally created for the .NET MicroFramework. I moved this code to GitHub in the hope that someone could find some use for it. As it stands, it is not complete.
